A new Flutter project.

# NIVEA
Hi, I made this app during my intern at Beiersdorf, India (famous for its product called Nivea).

This MVP is mainly focused on babycare and asking to collect reviews regarding the same.

If the Global Rnd head and Marketing head likes this prototype, our Rnd team will further get funding to launch an app on commercial scale.

Overall, it was an enjoyable task to learn and implement all this, linking things to backend on Firebase was the hardest part but enjoyed making this a lot with my supervisor here at BDF [Prachee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prachee-prabhutendolkar-b9623ab1/).

If you want to experience the app and suggest changes, you can check out the web version of app here, play it in your mobile screen.
